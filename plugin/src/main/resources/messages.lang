# Each line that starts with a '#' is ignored
# Each message line consist in an identifier and a value, separated by a '='
# If you use '=j' instead of '=', you can use json type messages

# For example, the two next lines store the text 'Hello' in red :
#legacy-message=&cHello
#message=j{"text":"Hello","color":"red"}
